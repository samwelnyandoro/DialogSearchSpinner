# DialogSearchSpinner

Android Spinner is a view that resembles a drop-down menu that is used to choose one item from a list of choices. When we click on it, a dropdown list of all values is displayed and it offers a simple method for choosing one item from the list of items. The presently selected value will be the android spinner's default value, and we can quickly link the items to the spinner objects by using an adapter. In order to give the user a better user experience and make it simple for them to search and select an item in a list of items, we are going to construct a custom searchable spinner in the Android Studio in this post.
